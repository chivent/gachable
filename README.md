# Gachable

Visit @ https://gachable-play.web.app/

An application to have your own digital gachapon experience.
If you'd like to test out the application, use https://gachable-play-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app/ to create a machine and play.

This project is still under development, and currently relies on React-Local Storage.
It is to have Elixir support for some operations soon, but that yet to be fully implemented and as such only react-based servers work for now (See issues for intended improvements).

To start your React server:

- cd into `frontend`
- Do `npm install` && `npm start`

Now you can visit [`localhost:3000/app`](http://localhost:3000/app) from your browser.
